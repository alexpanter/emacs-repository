;; Quoted from tuhdo.github.io/emacs-tutor3.html :
;; "I only use default configuration for "Text" group.
;; You can customize it if you want or leave this file blank,
;; so you can add customizations when needed.
;; This group is useful if you edit text frequently and need bibliography,
;; or you want to write Latex.
